This work is about Playing with Twitter Data in R!
## Steps covered in this projets:
- [Connecting to the Twitter API](/Twitter_Auth.r)

The first step is to configure and to conenct to the Twitter API. Since this work is not going to be a "Web Scrapping" Projet, we will need to connect directly to Twitter Data streams through thier API.

- [Extracting the Data from Twitter Feed](../R_Twitter )

From here we will extract the tweets text and other information that we will import from the Twitter API. 

- [Cleaning and structuring tweets data](/CleaningTweets.r)

In order for us to analyze the tweets, this particular type of data needs to be cleaned and stored in a certain way. Ponctuations, White spaces, Stop Words..and others should be cleaned and handeled in a specific way.
